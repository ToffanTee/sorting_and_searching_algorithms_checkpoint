# Insertion Sort Algorithm

> This algorithm uses the insertion sort technique to sort the elements of the array in ascending order.

## What the algorithm does

1. It iterates over each element of the array, starting from the second element (i=1) to the last element (i=N).
2. Inside the loop, it selects the current element as the key and compares it with the elements before it in the sorted portion of the array.
3. It shifts the larger elements to the right to make space for the key in its correct sorted position.
4. The process continues until the key is correctly placed in the sorted portion of the array.
